# install_ffmpeg.py
#
# Utility function to ensure FFmpeg is installed and available in the environment.
#
# - Installs ffmpeg-python (Python bindings for FFmpeg) using pip.
# - Downloads and installs a static FFmpeg binary if not already present.
# - Verifies the installation by running `ffmpeg -version`.
# - Returns True if FFmpeg is available, otherwise False.
#
# This script is especially useful in cloud environments (e.g., AWS SageMaker) where FFmpeg may not be pre-installed,
# and is required for audio/video processing tasks.
